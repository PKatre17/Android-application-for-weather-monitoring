# Android application for weather monitoring

This project was done in a group of three people where we made an android application to monitor the weather parameters like: Temperature, Wind speed, and Humidity by following below steps:
  1. First step was to design a PCB (Printed Circiut Board) on Eagle.
  2. This PCB was then connected to the sensors to measure temperature, wind-speed, and humidity.
  3. We used Firebase Realtime Database to build and ship our on Android platform.
